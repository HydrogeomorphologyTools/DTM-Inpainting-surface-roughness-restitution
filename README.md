# DTM-Inpainting-surface-roughness-restitution
Matlab script to carry out heat diffusion based inpainting over missing data area and to render back on top of the interpolation a realistic surface roughnes/testure
Credits to John D'Errico (2012) for the inpaint_nans function (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4551-inpaint-nans) and to
Wolfgang Schwanghart for the amazing Topo-Toolbox set of tools (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/50124-topotoolbox)

Usage example: clone or dowload the repository: https://github.com/HydrogeomorphologyTools/DTM-Inpainting-surface-roughness-restitution 
and run the present script "as is" with the provided inputs and dependance files. Investigation is still needed on DTM-related performance.
Enjoy!
